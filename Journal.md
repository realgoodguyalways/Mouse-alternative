## May/20/25:
   ### I spent time working on making a cad model of my design. I created a basic design, but not all measurements are correct. 
   ## full model:

   ## base:

   ### I made it hollow for the pcb, microcontroller, and other components, I put a hole in the side of the model so I can access a usb port, and put a hole in the cap of the base so the joystick can connect to the joystick module connected to the pcb.
   ## joystick:

   ### I made the inside of the joystick semi hollow so the durability is not comprimised, but I am still able to run wires through it. I put two holes in the bottom of the slanted hold for buttons which will corrispond to left and right click, and I made the hold slanted for better ergonomics.
